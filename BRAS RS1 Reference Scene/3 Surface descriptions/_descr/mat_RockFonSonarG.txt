Notes:						This file contains information about the boundary conditions of the material "mat_RockFonSonarG"
							All relevant values are given in separate files in the csv-format
							
							The data corresponds an infinte surface of absorber sheets (w=600 mm, l=600mm, h=20mm).
							Edge/diffraction effects (due to limited distances and reflector sizes in scenes RS1 and RS2) have to be modelled (or neglected) by the user
							Material was provided by the company RockFon (ROCKWOOL)
							Product details can be found here: http://rwiumbraco-rfn.inforce.dk/media/3231070/de-rockfon-sonar.pdf

## Material information:

Scenes:						RS1, RS2
Origin of data: 			0°: Impedance tube, ISO 10534-2 between 100 Hz - 4 kHz; estimated/extrapolated for lower and higher frequencies

## Additional information:

Processing of measurements:	Edge (diffraction) effects on absorption are neglected / corresponding frequency range is interpolated (100 Hz - 300 Hz) for angle-depedant measurements
